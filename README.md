# Text-to-CAD: Natural Language Interface for Computer-Aided Design

### Executive Summary
This document outlines the architecture and implementation approach for a web-based system that converts natural language descriptions into 3D CAD models using FreeCAD. The system aims to bridge the gap between human language and technical CAD specifications, making 3D modeling more accessible to non-technical users while maintaining the precision required for professional applications.

### System Architecture

#### Frontend Stack
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as build tool and development server
- Three.js for 3D model visualization
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios for API communication

#### Backend Stack
- FastAPI (Python) for API endpoints
- FreeCAD Python API for CAD operations
- Pydantic for data validation
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests


The text-to-CAD project represents a innovative approach to CAD modeling, leveraging modern web technologies and open-source tools. While there are significant technical challenges, the architecture provides a solid foundation for addressing them. The focus on modern development practices and scalable infrastructure positions the project well for future growth and enhancement.
